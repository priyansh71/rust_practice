- Each value in Rust is associated to a variable that is called it's owner.
- A resource can only have one owner at a time. 
- When a resource goes out of the scope, Rust removes it from the Memory, value is dropped.
- When we want to reuse the same resource, we are referencing it/ borrowing its content.
- At any time we can have either one mutable reference or multiple immutable references.
- References must always be valid ```ft.``` Borrow Checker.
