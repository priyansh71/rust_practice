- Memory management is a form of resource management applied to computer memory. ```C``` uses manual Memory Management which requires the programmer to give manual instructions to identify and deallocate unused objects/ garbage.
- Garbage collection(GC) is used by ```Java``` & ```C#```, and is form of Automatic Memory Management(AMM). It determines what memory is no longer used and frees it automatically instead of relying on the programmer.
