- Primitive types:
    - Integers : u8, i8, u16, i16, u32, i32, u64, i64, u128, i128
    - Floats : f32,f64
    - Booleans : (bool)
    - Characters : (char)
    - Tuples
    - Arrays
- Rust is statically typed and thus must know the type of all variables at compile time.
- However, the compiler can usually infer the type we want to use based on the value and how we use it.
- Default ```int``` is i32. Default ```float``` is f64.
- Primitive str = immutable fixed-length string somewhere in memory.
- String = Growable, heap- allocated data structure - use when needed to modify a string or own its data.
- Tuples are used to group together data of different types. Maximum capacity is 12 items.
- Arrays are fixed and contain the same data types.
- Members of a vector are stored on the heap.
- Conditionals are used to check the condition of something and then act on the result.
- Functions : store blocks of code for re-use. There is no return keyword.
- Reference Pointers : Point to a resource in memory.
    - In case of non-primitives, if you assign another variable a piece of data, the first variable
    will no longer hold its value. You'll need a reference i.e. & to point to that resource.
- Structures are used to create custom data types.
- Enums are types which have few definite values.
